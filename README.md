# A320 copilot
A copilot addon for MS FS2020. Reminds the captain of important checks during a flight. 
Tested on the FlyByWire A320-Neo but may also function well on airplanes with comparable performance.

# Features
The copilot voices the following reminders:
- When reaching cruise altitude: 
  - to turn off seat belt lights and 
  - to prepare descent and arrival procedures.
- When starting the descent:
  - to set TCAS radar to below, 
  - complete destination data in the FMS and 
  - request ATIS information for arrival.
- When passing 10000 feet:
  - to turn on seatbelt lights,
  - turn on landing system,
  - update arrival QNH setting,
  - and limit speed to 250 knots.
- On final approach:
  - to lower the landing gear,
  - arm spoilers,
  - set go-around altitude,
  - set autobreak,
  - and alert the cabin-crew.

```
